Daniel:
Look into replacing the SAE and model with Gemma Scope 2 and Gemma 3. 

Nina:
Look into what methods of dimensionality reduction would be best. 
- seems like the recommended method would have been PCA, but we could do factor analysis or Principle Factor analysis, which are similar to PCA but do offer a change from the original paper
- we could look at independent component analysis methods https://computing.llnl.gov/sites/default/files/148494.pdf which could offer non-linear dimension reduction, but not sure if that makese sense for our project
Maybe also what clustering would be best. 
- seems like "location" based clustering is best (K-means or centroid-based).
  - centroid based does not do well with noise, K-Means is only spherical results
    - which of these do we consider to be less of an issue

DUE: 2/5/2026


Nina:
- write the new clustering method into the code
- see if changing the dimensionality reduction makes sense

Daniel:
- Try replacing models with Gemma 3 and Gemma Scope 2
