Daniel:
Look into replacing the SAE and model with Gemma Scope 2 and Gemma 3. 

Nina:
Look into what methods of dimensionality reduction would be best. 
Maybe also what clustering would be best. 
- seems like "location" based clustering is best (K-means or centroid-based).
  - centroid based does not do well with noise, K-Means is only spherical results
    - which of these do we consider to be less of an issue
